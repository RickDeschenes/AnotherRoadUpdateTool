I have a terrain update that allows the user to select an area** and update the area to the height they entered.
Issue: sometimes when updating I get low level errors that are not in my code so I cannot see a good work around.
Issue: my undo has a lot to be desired, if you cross over your prior updated area the undo does not work
In the update roads mode the user selects an area to update all road type A to road type be.
  there are options to handle tunnels, slopes and crurves
Issue: Sometime I encounter errors 6 to ten layers below my original calls.
  I have adressed most of the usability error by recalling the update
  However there are still some errors where roads to not get updated or 
  worse update to bridges on top of the original road that should have been replaced
