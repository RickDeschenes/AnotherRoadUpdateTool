Cities: Skylines MOD

This MOD combines many mods into a control panel.
Features:
Taggle Chirper on and Off
Toggle and process Auto Delete of abandoned and/or built building
swap or upgrade roads from a selected area.
delete item types from a selected area
toggle selected services on or off in a selected area (Game Modes only)
Change map height in a selected area (Map Modes only)

Why did I write this, to allow me to open a new map, add in a set of roads that are only highways and ramps and to save this map.
Next I open a new city using this map with unlimited money and plot out my entire city.
I can then select alls ervices and toggle them off.
I can upgrade some of the roads from highway ramps, or all of them.
I can make a city with everything I need to be profitable available but not costing me 'upkeep'
I can save this as a starter city and then turn off unlimited money and see how quickly the city is profitable
I can also see if my optimisations tweaks are working.

When I have a city with large light green housing and lots of industrial areas I can turn off all servcies.
I can than replot the area with out needing to turn everything off,

Wait you need to add these!
Please add auto delete for building with not enough, or dead people....
