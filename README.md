Why did I write this, to allow me to open a new map, add in a set of roads that are only highways and ramps and to save this map. Next I open a new city using this map with unlimited money and plot out my entire city. I can then select alls ervices and toggle them off. I can upgrade some of the roads from highway ramps, or all of them. I can make a city with everything I need to be profitable available but not costing me 'upkeep' I can save this as a starter city and then turn off unlimited money and see how quickly the city is profitable I can also see if my optimisations tweaks are working.

When I have a city with large light green housing and lots of industrial areas I can turn off all servcies. I can than replot the area with out needing to turn everything off,

Wait you need to add these! Please add auto delete for building with not enough, or dead people....
